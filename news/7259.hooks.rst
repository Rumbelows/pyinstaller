Improve compatibility with contemporary ``Django`` 4.x version by removing
the override of ``django.core.management.get_commands`` from the ``Django``
run-time hook. The static command list override is both outdated (based on
``Django`` 1.8) and unnecessary due to dynamic command list being properly
populated under contemporary versions of ``PyInstaller`` and ``Django``.
